# HillClimbRacing
Hill Climb Racing is a 2012 2D physics-based racing video game released by the Finnish studio Fingersoft for Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows, and Windows Phone. It was originally created by Toni Fingerroos, Fingersoft's founder, and is the company's best-known product. The player controls a driver across hilly terrains, collecting coins along the way and spending them on vehicular upgrades while being watchful of the driver's head as well as the vehicle's fuel supply. <br>
This is an attempt to create a prototype of the same game.<br>
I think it would have worked if it had more levels ;p
